# OS Mini Project: Scheduling Algorithm GUI

Welcome to the OS Mini Project! This GUI tool lets you simulate various process scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF, SRTN, Priority, and Round Robin.

## How to Use

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)

### Running the Program
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `python OS-Mini-Project-Scheduling-Algorithm.py`.

### Input Parameters
- First, select the process scheduling algorithm.
- Enter the number of processes.
- Then, for each process:
  - Enter arrival time, burst time, and priority (optional).
- Choose an algorithm and, for Round Robin, specify the quantum.

### Viewing Results
- Click "Submit" to see completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each process.
- Scroll down for average turnaround time and average waiting time.

## Algorithms
1. FCFS
2. SJF
3. SRTN
4. Priority Scheduling
5. Round Robin
