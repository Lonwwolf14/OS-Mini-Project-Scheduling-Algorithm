# OS Mini Project: Scheduling Algorithm GUI

Welcome to the OS Mini Project repository! This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for simulating various process scheduling algorithms. From First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) to Priority and Round Robin, this tool allows you to visualize and analyze the performance of different scheduling techniques.

## How to Use

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### Installing Tkinter (if not installed)
- **For Windows**: Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python. If not, you can install it using the following command:
  ```
  pip install tk
  ```

- **For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: You can install Tkinter using the package manager:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```

- **For macOS**: Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python on macOS.

### Running the Program
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the following command:

    ```
    python OS-Mini-Project-Scheduling-Algorithm.py
    ```

5. The GUI window should appear, ready for you to input the necessary parameters and select the scheduling algorithm you want to simulate.

### Input Parameters
- **Number of Processes**: Enter the total number of processes you want to simulate scheduling for.
- **Scheduling Algorithm**: Choose the desired algorithm from the drop-down menu (FCFS, SJF, SRTN, Priority, or Round Robin).
- **Quantum (for Round Robin)**: If you select the Round Robin algorithm, specify the time quantum.

For each process, you will need to enter the following details:
- **Arrival Time**: The time at which the process arrives in the system.
- **Burst Time**: The total time required by the process for execution.
- **Priority (optional)**: Priority of the process (only applicable for Priority scheduling).

### Submitting and Viewing Results
- Once you have entered all the necessary parameters, click the "Submit" button.
- The GUI will display the completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each process.
- Scroll down in the result display area to see the detailed results, including average turnaround time and average waiting time.

## About the Algorithms
